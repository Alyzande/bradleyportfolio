The coding problem was that we needed to output number 1 to n with some replaced by Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz.  We decided to collect inputs from a text box, ensuring n was an integer, and display numbers from 1 to n as strings on the page below the text box because the user could see and adjust their input and see the output changing as their input changed.  We brainstormed the edge cases, and discovered potential problems that needed to be handled: if n was a negative number or zero, or not a number. We decided to display a pop up message because we needed to display it without interrupting the flow of the page contents. 

We broke our problem down, calling the starting number ‘n’ and began by initialising a variable to hold the output. We chose a for loop to go through the numbers 1 to n and increase the count. We used an if-else statement to check if the current number was divisible by 5 or 3, and if  so to output a string and otherwise to output the number.  This output was collected as a string into the starting variable. We outputted that variable to the screen using document.getElementById().innerHTML.  We started to write the steps as pseudo code, to show understanding and keep us on track, then we made some code to match the steps and then we refactored it.
